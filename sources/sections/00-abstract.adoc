== Abstract

This specification defines an extension to the calendar
access protocol (CalDAV) to allow attachments associated with
iCalendar data to be stored and managed on the server.

This specification documents existing code deployed by
multiple vendors. It is published as an Informational
specification rather than Standards Track due to its
noncompliance with multiple best current practices of HTTP.
