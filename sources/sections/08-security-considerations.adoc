== Security Considerations

The security considerations in <<RFC4791>> and <<RFC4918>> apply to this
extension. Additionally, servers need to be aware that a client could attack
underlying storage by POSTing extremely large attachments and could attack
processing time by uploading a recurring event with a large number of overrides
and then repeatedly adding, updating, and deleting attachments.

Malicious content could be introduced into the calendar server by way of a
managed attachment, and propagated to many end users via scheduling. Servers
`SHOULD` check managed attachments for malicious or inappropriate content. Upon
detecting of such content, servers `SHOULD` remove the attachment, following the
rules described in <<auto-cleanup>>.
