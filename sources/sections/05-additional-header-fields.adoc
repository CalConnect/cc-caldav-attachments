=== `Cal-Managed-ID` Response Header Field

The `Cal-Managed-ID` response header field provides the value of
the `MANAGED-ID` parameter corresponding to a newly added `ATTACH`
property.

ABNF::
+
--
[source%unnumbered]
----
Cal-Managed-ID = "Cal-Managed-ID" ":" paramtext
; "paramtext" is defined in <<RFC5545,section=3.1>>
----

Example::
+
--
[source%unnumbered]

Cal-Managed-ID:aUNhbGVuZGFy
----

The Cal-Managed-ID header field `MUST` only be sent by an
origin server in response to a successful `POST` request with an
action set to attachment-add or attachment-update. It `MUST`
only appear once in a response and `MUST NOT` appear in trailers.

The Cal-Managed-ID header field is end to end and `MUST` be
forwarded by intermediaries. Intermediaries `MUST NOT` insert,
delete, or modify a Cal-Managed-ID header field.
